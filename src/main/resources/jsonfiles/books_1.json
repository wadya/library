    "description": "Augmented reality (AR) offers a live direct or indirect view of a physical, real-world environment, where the elements and surroundings are augmented by computer-generated sensory input such as graphics and GPS data. It makes a game more real. Your social media app puts you where want to be or go. Pro Android Augmented Reality walks you through the foundations of building an augmented reality application. From using various software and Android hardware sensors, such as an accelerometer or a magnetometer (compass), you'll learn the building blocks of augmented reality for both marker- and location-based apps. Case studies are included in this one-of-a-kind book, which pairs nicely with other Android development books. After reading Pro Android Augmented Reality, you'll be able to build augmented reality rich media apps or integrate all the best augmented reality into your favorite Android smartphone and/or tablet. What you’ll learn How to use most Android cameras How to find the user's location with GPS data How to detect movement and orientation of the device How to program against the accelerometer and compass How to use the AndAR library in marker recognition How to create an artificial horizon for your app How to integrate the Google Maps API into AR apps How to build enterprise augmented reality apps using the case studies in this book Who this book is for This book is for Android developers familiar with Android programming, but new to the camera, accelerometer, magnetometer and building augmented reality applications in general.

    "description": "Humans and androids are learning to co-exist as equals, but there are many opposers who seek to subvert their own creations and rule with absolute power ...Humans, with their android creations loyally at their side, have colonised the Moon and Mars. The Earth and Colonies Defence Service (ECDS) keeps the colonies and space lanes safe. On Earth, the Android Protectorate League, led by the enigmatic android leader Traviod Selius, campaign for android rights legislation. However, they are strongly opposed by the Anti-Android Faction (AAF). Following the approval of the Human and Android Cohabitation Act, ECDS Chief of Operations Nakaar Bacvor and co-conspirators form the military wing of the AAF. The AAF attack the Moon and Mars colonies, but are repulsed by ECDS forces. On Earth, with the AAF seemingly defeated, humans and androids unite to create the city of Utopia. Threats from a reformed, more powerful AAF emerges and the crew of the ECDS flagship Harmonia must formulate a defence. The mysterious Evolved Androids appear on Earth with a sytoid child called Eirini, who has strange powers. Utopian Enforcement officer Rul Calibra becomes her unlikely guardian and protector.Humankind's destiny hangs in the balance in the first series installment ANDROID: Earth - Book One of the ANDROID Saga. Paul J. Ward was born in 1969 in Lincolnshire, England, on the day of the historic Apollo 11 moon landing. He has been fascinated by space exploration and technological developments his whole life. This is his first novel. Publisher's website: http: //sbpra.com/PaulJWar",

In this book, Android programming expert Chris Haseman shows you how to use the powerful set of Android tools to begin writing the next generation of Android applications. Chris provides a complete introduction to developing for Google’s mobile OS, offering tons of insights and hard-earned advice. After a tour of how to install and configure the Android SDK and Eclipse IDE, you jump right in, building your first Android project. Chris starts off with how to use the major building blocks to create an intuitive and good-looking interface. Next, he shows you how to retrieve data and how to use lists to display data. Chris then explores how to use services—important, and often under-utilized, components of the Android platform. Chris examines how to handle media and location services before showing you how to write applications for the Android ecosystem.",
